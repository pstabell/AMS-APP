# Trial Signup End-to-End Test Report

**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Tester:** Forge
**Repo:** AMS-APP
**Card:** Activation Engine: End-to-End Trial Signup Test

## Scope
Validate the solo-agent trial signup path from signup form through Stripe checkout configuration, account provisioning webhook behavior, and onboarding email path.

## Latest Update
- 2026-04-05 1:27 PM ET: Added a generated `escalation-packet.zip` bundle to the smoke-check output, so every send-ready Render packet now ships as both individual files and a single attachable archive for support tickets that only want one upload.
- Expanded `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py` so both the live escalation packet and its timestamped archive now write the zip bundle automatically, updated `artifact_inventory` and packet instructions to reference the bundle, and added regression coverage in `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` for zip generation, archive naming, and end-to-end CLI output.
- Validation: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` passed after the bundle change, and the latest smoke-check rerun still shows the same external Render routing outage.
- 2026-04-05 7:17 AM ET: Added a generated `README.txt` to the escalation packet output, so every smoke-check run now includes a human-forwardable packet cover sheet alongside the send-ready Render support message, JSON payload, and evidence manifest.
- Expanded `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py` so both the live escalation packet and its timestamped archive now write the new README automatically, and expanded `artifact_inventory` so the README is listed in the recommended attachment bundle and Render support packet file list.
- Added regression coverage in `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` for README generation, packet writing, archive writing, and the full CLI flow. Validation: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` passed 202/202.
- Refreshed the live artifacts with `python3 scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py --json-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.json --markdown-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.md --owner-messages-dir docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready --owner-messages-archive-dir docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready/archive --escalation-packet-dir docs/smoke-checks/escalation-packet --escalation-packet-archive-dir docs/smoke-checks/escalation-packet/archive`, which now regenerates the send-ready packet, the new zip bundle, and archived snapshots.
- Fresh live outage evidence is still unchanged: `https://commission-tracker-app.onrender.com` returned HTTP 200 while `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/health` still returned HTTP 404 with `x-render-routing=no-server`, so the next external move remains with Traction and Render support.
- 2026-04-05 5:14 AM ET: Added `--escalation-packet-archive-dir` support to `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py`, so each smoke-check run can now preserve timestamped Render support packet snapshots under `docs/smoke-checks/escalation-packet/archive/` instead of only overwriting the latest send-ready message, JSON payload, and evidence manifest.
- Added shared escalation-packet file generation plus archive path helpers, expanded `artifact_inventory` to track the escalation packet archive folder and latest archived files, and added regression coverage in `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` for archive path generation, archive writing, inventory expectations, and the full CLI path with packet archiving enabled.
- Validation target for this refresh: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py`, then rerun `python3 scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py --json-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.json --markdown-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.md --owner-messages-dir docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready --owner-messages-archive-dir docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready/archive --escalation-packet-dir docs/smoke-checks/escalation-packet --escalation-packet-archive-dir docs/smoke-checks/escalation-packet/archive`.
- Fresh live outage expectation remains unchanged until Render is repaired externally: `https://commission-tracker-app.onrender.com` should still return HTTP 200 while `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/health` still returns HTTP 404 with `x-render-routing=no-server`.
- 2026-04-05 1:19 AM ET: Added `--owner-messages-archive-dir` support to `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py`, so each smoke-check run can now preserve timestamped `traction`, `render_support`, and `verification_shell` handoff snapshots under `docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready/archive/` instead of only overwriting the latest packet.
- Expanded `artifact_inventory` to track the live owner-ready text files plus the archive folder and latest snapshot files, so Traction and Render support can attach the current packet or pull an exact historical handoff without guessing paths.
- Added regression coverage in `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` for archive path generation, archive file writing, updated artifact inventory expectations, and the full CLI path with archive output enabled.
- Validation: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` passed 198/198. Refreshed artifacts with `python3 scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py --json-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.json --markdown-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.md --owner-messages-dir docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready --owner-messages-archive-dir docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready/archive`, and the latest report now records the archived handoff packet.
- Fresh live evidence is still unchanged on the outage itself: `https://commission-tracker-app.onrender.com` returns HTTP 200 while `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/health` still returns HTTP 404 with `x-render-routing=no-server`.
- 2026-04-04 11:16 PM ET: Added `--owner-messages-dir` support to `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py`, so each smoke-check run can now write copy-ready `traction.txt`, `render_support.txt`, and `verification_shell.txt` handoff files directly to `docs/smoke-checks/owner-ready/` instead of forcing the next owner to copy text out of JSON or Markdown manually.
- Added regression coverage in `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` to lock that behavior in at the `generate_report(...)` level instead of only unit-testing `build_change_summary(...)` in isolation.
- Validation: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` passed 195/195, and a fresh `python3 scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py --json-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.json --markdown-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.md` run now reports `No material change detected versus the previous smoke-check artifact.` with a correct unchanged blocked streak instead of bogus `None` comparisons.
- 2026-04-04 7:14 PM ET: Added `artifact_inventory` to `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py`, so every smoke-check JSON and Markdown artifact now lists the exact evidence files, relative repo paths, existence flags, sizes, timestamps, and recommended attachment bundles for Traction and Render support.
- This removes another manual handoff step: the next owner no longer has to guess which files to attach when escalating the Render outage or re-running the verification packet.
- Updated `owner_action_plan` guidance so Traction explicitly attaches the latest smoke-check JSON, Markdown, trial-signup report, and `render.yaml`, and so the verification shell re-attaches refreshed evidence after each rerun.
- Added regression coverage for the new artifact inventory block in `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` and verified the Markdown report renders the new section.
- Validation: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` passed 194/194, then `python3 scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py --json-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.json --markdown-out docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.md` refreshed the latest evidence packet.

## What Was Verified

### 1. Automated checkout and webhook regression suite
Command run:

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py
```

Result:
- 152 tests ran
- 152 tests passed

Coverage confirmed by the existing regression suite includes:
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy acceptance required before checkout
- Stripe checkout session built in subscription mode
- 14-day free trial applied
- `payment_method_collection='if_required'`
- Legal-acceptance metadata attached to checkout
- Success-page resend-setup flow
- Expired setup-token resend flow
- Subscription status normalization and webhook fallback logic
- Tier resolution from Stripe price IDs
- Payment recovery webhook logic
- Smoke-check readiness gate behavior for green and blocked deployment states via `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py`

### 2. Checkout session contract
Confirmed from live code in `auth_helpers.py` and direct invocation of `_build_checkout_kwargs(...)`:
- mode: `subscription`
- trial period: `14` days
- payment method collection: `if_required`
- promotion codes enabled: `True`
- success URL: `https://commission-tracker-app.onrender.com/?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
- cancel URL: `https://commission-tracker-app.onrender.com`
- metadata includes:
  - accepted_terms=true
  - accepted_privacy=true
  - accepted_at timestamp
  - terms_version=2024-12-06
  - privacy_version=2024-12-06

### 3. Live app reachability
Checked:
- `https://commission-tracker-app.onrender.com`

Result:
- Main Streamlit app is reachable and returns HTTP 200.

## Blockers / Breaks Found

### 1. Live webhook service appears misconfigured at the public Render URL
Checked:
- `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/`
- `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/health`
- `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/test`
- `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/stripe-webhook`

Result:
- All four probed endpoints return HTTP 404 `Not Found`
- Every probed webhook response also includes the header `x-render-routing: no-server`

Impact:
- This is stronger evidence than a single missing `/health` route.
- The live hostname is not just missing one endpoint; Render is explicitly signaling that no healthy backend server is attached to that route.
- The likely issue is Render service wiring, missing deployment attachment to the custom hostname, or a webhook service that is not currently standing up behind `commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com`.
- A real Stripe checkout cannot be trusted to provision an account and trigger onboarding email until the live webhook service is restored at the expected public URL.

### 2. Local workspace does not have the secrets needed for a real external end-to-end purchase test
Missing in the current shell:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `APP_URL`
- `APP_PASSWORD`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

Available:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Impact:
- I could validate code paths and regression coverage locally.
- I could not execute a true paid external Stripe checkout from this workspace with live billing, live webhook signature validation, and live onboarding email delivery.

## Assessment
The codebase appears healthy for the trial signup flow based on the current regression suite and direct inspection of checkout and webhook logic. The active risk is deployment/runtime, not the core Python logic.

The most important production issue found is that the documented webhook health URL currently returns 404. That blocks a trustworthy real-world confirmation of account provisioning and onboarding email delivery.

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Restore or verify the live Render webhook service at `commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com`.
2. Apply the checked-in `render.yaml` blueprint so Render explicitly uses `gunicorn webhook_server:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT}` with `healthCheckPath: /health` for the webhook service and the Streamlit start command for the main app.
3. Run `python3 scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py` before and after the Render change to capture a consistent readiness snapshot for the public app URL, public webhook health URL, local `/health` route, and required live E2E environment variables.
4. After the webhook health endpoint is reachable, run one real Stripe test-mode trial signup using a test card or no-card-required trial path.
5. Confirm in production logs that:
   - `checkout.session.completed` is received
   - user row is created or updated in `users`
   - setup token is inserted into `password_reset_tokens`
   - password setup email is sent successfully
6. Capture the subscriber email, Stripe session ID, and webhook log timestamp in a follow-up report.

## Follow-up Automation Added
A lightweight smoke-check helper now lives at `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py`.

It reports:
- Public app reachability
- Public webhook health reachability
- Multi-endpoint webhook diagnostics across `/`, `/health`, `/test`, and `/stripe-webhook`
- Local Flask `/health` route status from `webhook_server.py`
- Presence of the core env vars needed for a true live end-to-end trial test

The script exits non-zero until the stack is genuinely ready for a live signup test, so it can also be reused in CI or a deployment shell as a fast gate.

It now also supports `--json-out` and `--markdown-out` so each run can leave behind a machine-readable snapshot plus a clean handoff note for operations after a Render change.

It now captures key response headers as part of the diagnostic snapshot, including Render routing fingerprints like `x-render-routing` and origin-server hints when present. That makes it easier to distinguish app-code failures from infrastructure states such as Render returning `no-server` before the request ever reaches Flask.

It now also emits explicit `blocking_reasons` and `next_actions` in both JSON and Markdown output so operations gets a ready-to-forward remediation list instead of having to infer the next move from raw probe data.

It now also statically verifies the checked-in Stripe checkout contract in `auth_helpers.py` without needing Streamlit to import locally, so each smoke-check run confirms the solo-agent flow still uses subscription mode, a 14-day trial, `payment_method_collection='if_required'`, promotion codes enabled, the expected success and cancel URLs, and the legal-acceptance metadata keys.

It now also verifies the checked-in `render.yaml` blueprint itself, confirming both Render services are declared with the expected start commands, health check paths, and required environment variable keys. That separates repo-side deploy configuration drift from the still-live external Render routing failure.

It now also emits a targeted `render_restore_checklist` in both JSON and Markdown output. That checklist names the exact Render service, expected hostname, checked-in start command, health check path, and the follow-up verification step so ops can restore the webhook runtime without reverse-engineering the repo first.

It now also emits `render_restore_validation_commands` in both JSON and Markdown output. That gives ops a copy-paste validation sequence covering the public webhook probe, smoke-check rerun, secret loading, artifact refresh, and regression suite after the Render service is restored.

It now also emits `local_webhook_dependency_commands` in both JSON and Markdown output so anyone verifying parity locally gets exact install and recheck commands when Flask or Stripe are missing from the shell.

## Latest refresh
- Added a Render hostname diagnostics matrix to the smoke-check summary so ops can see, in one section, which public hostname is healthy and which one is missing a backend attachment.
- Updated `scripts/trial_signup_smoke_check.py` and `test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` so the JSON and Markdown artifacts now include `render_hostname_diagnostics` alongside the existing domain-attachment, env-gap, and service-contract handoff sections.
- Fresh evidence now explicitly classifies `commission-tracker-app.onrender.com` as `healthy-attached` with `x-render-origin-server=TornadoServer/6.5.5`, while `commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com` is classified as `missing-backend-attachment` with `HTTP 404` and `x-render-routing=no-server` on `/health`.
- Added a new `render_incident_signature` section to the smoke-check output so the handoff now states, in one line, whether the failure pattern isolates cleanly to external Render routing/domain binding versus a repo-side regression.
- Added a new `render_recovery_playbook` section to the smoke-check output so the generated artifact now gives ops an ordered recovery sequence starting with webhook domain attachment, then deploy contract verification, then secret loading, then the final ready-for-live-e2e gate.
- Validation: `python3 -m unittest test_checkout_flow.py test_webhook_subscription_status.py test_trial_signup_smoke_check.py` passed 173/173
- Fresh artifacts:
  - `docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.json`
  - `docs/smoke-checks/latest-trial-signup-smoke-check.md`
- Current blocker remains external in production: `https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com` still returns `404 Not Found` with `x-render-routing: no-server` on `/`, `/health`, `/test`, and `/stripe-webhook`, and the new incident signature flags that split as an external Render service/domain binding problem rather than an app-code route regression. This shell still lacks the live Stripe, Resend, service-role Supabase, Render app URL, and webhook SMTP values needed to complete the live verification path.
- Added a `change_summary` section to the smoke-check JSON and Markdown outputs so each fresh run now compares itself to the previous artifact instead of forcing ops to diff snapshots manually.
- Added an `unchanged_blocked_streak` counter so repeated blocked runs with no recovery now accumulate visibly in the artifact instead of reading like isolated one-off failures.
- Added `public_probe_commands` so the smoke-check artifacts now include the exact copy-paste `curl -i` commands for the public app plus every webhook endpoint in the probe matrix, making external escalation and repro faster.
- Added `render_escalation_payload` so the smoke-check artifacts now include a structured, ticket-ready incident packet with severity, ownership, host evidence, requested action, and the exact missing secrets still blocking the final live Stripe confirmation.

## Conclusion
Status: **Blocked for full live end-to-end confirmation**

Reason:
- Live webhook health endpoint returns 404 and Render fingerprints the hostname with `x-render-routing: no-server`
- Local webhook import verification is also blocked in this shell because `flask` and `stripe` are not installed
- Required live Stripe/email secrets are not available in the current workspace session

Latest artifact refresh:
- `docs/smoke-checks/trial-signup-smoke-check-2026-04-02T1714ET.json`
- `docs/smoke-checks/trial-signup-smoke-check-2026-04-02T1714ET.md`

Automated coverage status: **Pass**
Deployment/runtime validation status: **Blocked pending webhook restoration and a shell with webhook dependencies/secrets**
